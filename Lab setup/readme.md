<div align="left"><h2>Lab Setup</h2></div>

<p>Lab setup is a crucial part of studying cybersecurity, since you will be doing most of your testing on this isolated environment without the fear to harm anyone unethically, in this evironment you will be working inside a NAT network where you will have access to all the vulnerable machines/boxes. You can test and hone your skills on those machines/boxes</p>

<p> But staying inside this lab environment won't help you keep up with the constantly changing technologies, for that there's something called CTF or often known as Capture the Flag, where you will have a remote vulnerable machine which you will have to attack and get the flag inside that specific machine, there are many websites where you can play CTFs.</p>

<div align="left"><h3>» Virtualization Software </h3></div>
<p>Even before choosing which operating system you want to use, you have choose which virtualization software you want to go with. Incase you hearing first time, Virtualization software will help you run a different OS than your host OS virtually. Now there are different ones that you can go for, most popular choice is vmware and vbox, but one is paid and one is free, you can techincally use vmware player which is somewhat free but it really comes down to preference. 

- **[VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)** - VMware Workstation Pro lets you run multiple operating systems as virtual machines (including Windows VMs) on a single windows or Linux PC.
